Nginx Web Server Deployment and Monitoring
This repository contains the necessary files to deploy and monitor an Nginx web server on Kubernetes. Below are the steps to get started:

Deployment File (nginx.yaml)
The nginx.yaml file includes the following configurations:

Deployment: Defines the desired state for the Nginx pods.
Pod Configuration: Specifies the settings for both the Nginx pod and the Nginx Prometheus exporter.
Service: Defines a Kubernetes service to expose the Nginx deployment.
ConfigMap: Stores configuration data for the Nginx deployment.
Horizontal Scaling Configuration: Specifies settings for horizontal scaling of the Nginx deployment.
You can customize the values in the nginx.yaml file as needed before applying it.

Prometheus Operator Installation
Ensure that Helm is installed on your Kubernetes cluster, then run the following commands to install the Prometheus operator:

bash
Copy code
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
For more details and additional add-ons, refer to the official Prometheus operator repository.

Accessing Grafana
After installation, you can access Grafana by either:

Setting the Grafana service to NodePort for direct access (not recommended), or
Creating an Ingress that points to the Grafana service ClusterIP for a dedicated URL (recommended).
Configuring Prometheus Scraping
To scrape metrics from the Nginx exporter into Prometheus, apply the service-monitor.yaml configuration to add the Nginx exporter endpoints to the Prometheus scraping list.

Adding the Grafana Dashboard
Upload the dashboard.json file to Grafana to visualize the metrics scraped from the Nginx exporter:

Log into Grafana.
Navigate to "Add Dashboard."
Choose the option to upload a JSON file, then upload dashboard.json.
Notes
If Prometheus is already installed on your cluster, skip the Prometheus installation step and apply the service monitor after deploying Nginx.
Non-operator options are provided in files like prometheus.yaml and prometheus-service.yaml, although they are not fully implemented.
Note: The essential files required from this repository are nginx.yaml, service-monitor.yaml, and dashboard.json.
